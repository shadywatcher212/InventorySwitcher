Inventory Switcher
==================

A simple minecraft forge mod that allows players to save and switch between saved inventories.

The goal of this project is to make surivial mode a bit quicker by allowing players to create inventory "profiles" that they can switch between during gameplay.

Say for example you are busy in your mine and you would like to leave for a bit to check on your farm. Normally, you would have to drop your mining gear into a chest and take out your farming gear. With this mod, you could do this change instaneously and if you die, you would only lose the items in your current inventory.

How you do this is still under development, but the aim might be for a small command to perform all these tasks. There are no builds currently available but check back from time to time for developments!
